## Architecture Integration

### Smart Contract Integration

The strategy integrates with the core AIMM smart contract through:

```solidity
contract AIMM {
    struct PoolParameters {
        uint256 feeRate;          // AI-optimized fee (basis points)
        uint256 spreadMultiplier; // Volatility-adjusted spread
        uint256[] weights;        // Dynamic asset weights
        uint256 lastUpdate;      // AI update timestamp
        bool isActive;           // Emergency circuit breaker
    }
    
    function updateParameters(
        address pool,
        PoolParameters calldata params,
        bytes calldata aiSignature
    ) external;
}
